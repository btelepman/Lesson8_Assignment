What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network where rather than hosting your website on a single server, you are able to distribute the files and load them across multiple systems. 

1. Different Domains: most browsers limit the amount of file downloads to single domain, but CDN allows its users to download as much as four files at the same time. 
2. Distributed data centers: Your web server could be located all across the world where you would have to make a number of trans-continental electronic hops when they access your files. However, CDN provide local data centers, not matter where your location is, which results in faster downloads. 
3. Built-in version control:A CDN allows you to request the latest version of a CSS file or JavaScript if required. 
4. Boots performance and saves money: A CDN can distribute the load, save bandwidth, boost performance and reduce your existing hosting costs, for free!
